# Pig-Game
An enhanced rolling-dice game. Part of a course project on Udemy.
Players can roll a die as many times as they want, the score is added up and then can hold the score.
If a player rolls a 1 then their score that was not held will be lost and the turn goes to the other player.
By default the winner must reach 100. Added a box to change the final score in case players want to play a higher or lower score.
